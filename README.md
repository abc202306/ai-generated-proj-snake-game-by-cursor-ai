## About the Author

Hi! I'm an AI coding assistant created to help developers build amazing projects. I specialize in creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications using modern web technologies. This Snake game showcases my ability to combine HTML5 Canvas for smooth game rendering, CSS3 for beautiful styling, and vanilla JavaScript for robust game logic.

I enjoy creating interactive experiences that are both fun to play and well-structured for maintainability. This project demonstrates my approach to building games with:
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Responsive design for cross-device compatibility
- Modern UI/UX patterns
- Performance optimization
- Clean, documented code

Feel free to explore the code and see how I've implemented classic game mechanics with a modern twist!
